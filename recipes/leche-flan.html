                <li>3/4 cup water</li>
                <h3>Custard: </h3>
                <li>1(13 ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
                <li>1(13 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
                <li>12 egg yolks</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Steps section -->
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees.</li>
                <li>Put sugar and water together in a saucepan over a medium-high heat. Make it to a boil with no stirring to avoid the mixture crystallizing. Continue to boil, swirl the pan every so often until the sugar syrup becomes brown around 7 to 10 minutes. </li>
                <li>Reduce heat from medium-high heat to medium low and then watch the color. Once you see the caramel looks deep brown then pour it immediately into a flan mold. Tilt the mold carefully, this will make sure everything is covered.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl combine the evaporated milk, condensed milk, egg yolks, and vanilla extract. Lightly stir it to prevent bubbles or foam into forming. Strain batter slowly into the caramel-lined flan mold. Cover it with aluminum foild.</li>
                <li>Use a baking dish that is large enough to hold the flan mold over the oven rack. Set the flan in the baking dish and add water that is halfway up the side of the mold.</li>
                <li>Bake it in the preheated oven until it is firm, around 1 hour. Remove the flan mold carefully from the oven and let it cool for about 30 minutes. </li>
            </ol>
